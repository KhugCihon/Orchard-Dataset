# Introduction
Orchard-Dataset is a multimodal agricultural robotics dataset that provides both RGB-D images and navigational sensor data for localization and mapping tasks.
- It was collected by a wheeled mobile robot in an [orchard located in Goesan-gun, Chungcheongbuk-do, South Korea](https://www.google.co.kr/maps/place/%EC%B6%A9%EC%B2%AD%EB%B6%81%EB%8F%84+%EA%B4%B4%EC%82%B0%EA%B5%B0+%EB%B6%88%EC%A0%95%EB%A9%B4+%EC%95%B5%EC%B2%9C%EB%A6%AC+542-1/data=!3m2!1e3!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x35649273c2d74c27:0x10d6109892c3a95b!8m2!3d36.8987613!4d127.8019698!16s%2Fg%2F11bz5lsvc1?hl=ko&entry=ttu) in the summer of 2023.
- It offers a total of **five** sensing modalities, including stereo RGB, depth, LiDAR, IMU and GPS-RTK data.
